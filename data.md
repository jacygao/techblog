# Data Strategy
What we are doing. Why we are doing it. Commercial Benefits. 

How Data Strategy reflects an overarching Business Strategy.

Description of 
1. where the organisation is now (threats and opportunities); 

2. a vision for commercially advantageous future data capabilities; 

3. a path for moving between the current and the future states.

Data Strategy should consider the current state of the organisation with respect to the capture, manipulation and usage of Data (this involves assessing systems, processes and people’s behaviour), identity some future state which will result in superior business results (addressing issues with the current state and/or seizing new opportunities) and map out a way to move between the two. The superior business results are crucial. A Data Strategy is first and foremost a business strategy and must have clear business drivers and clear business outcomes.

On the assumption that the business focus is there, then a Data Strategy will typically cover what the future organisation will look like from a Data perspective. This should include: Data processes and controls (related to Data Governance); Data consistency, Integration, reuse and Data Quality; all underpinned by an overall Data Architecture. While tools are not the most important aspect of any Data Strategy, it makes sense to cover how Data Visualisation, Analytics and Business Intelligence will be supported as well as at least sketching out some of the back-end tool requirements.

On the human side, the Data Strategy will cover how people across the organisation are intended to access and leverage Data, there also needs to be some thought about teams dedicated to the Data arena. Will there be a Data Science team? Is a centralised Data Function necessary? And so on. Finally a good Data Strategy will highlight the need for strong educational and communications elements to any work undertaken.

roles:
Data engineers, who oversee the data pipeline and are responsible for building an efficient, reliable data architecture
Data scientists, who work with data that the pipeline delivers
Data analysts, who specialize in analyzing and interpreting data
Business managers, who help to manage data operations and review data reports

# Data architecture 

<support and facilitate the leverage, collation and control of data>

(1) The practice of determining business needs, modelling these and mapping them to appropriate Data structures, systems landscapes and integration / interface strategies. Data Architects generally have an in-depth understanding of Data and its usage and so can be more technologically experienced than some architects in other fields.

Data Architects tend to engage with Change programmes, both to instil good Data practice and also to guard against the typically deleterious impact of such programmes on Data Assets over time. They are also heavily involved in the design and implementation of Data-centric capabilities and the delivery of Data to other teams (e.g. Digital).

(2) The overall technology and process landscape pertaining to the capture, maintenance, Integration and leverage of Data in an organisation. This would include facilities supporting Data Quality, Master Data Management, Data Repositories, Analytics and so on; supported by Data Governance and related areas.

- data arena

- data warehouse
A Database holding Data from many disparate sources in a common format which allows the comparison of apples and oranges. A regular warehouse is a big building in which many things may be stored, but which has an indexing system which allows them to be located and retrieved easily. A Data warehouse is essentially the same concept. Good Data Warehouses have business meaning “baked” into them. Data Warehouses generally follow a Multidimensional Paradigm (related to OLAP) where Data is held in Fact Tables (tables covering numbers such as revenue or costs) and Dimensions (things we want to view the facts by, such as region, office, or week).

- Data Lake
A Data Lake is a Big Data repository in to which copies of source systems are periodically replicated. The Data Lake is the one of the resources that Data Scientists leverage to create Insight.

- big data
A suite of Open Source technologies (clustered around the Apache Hadoop platform) which leverage multiple commodity servers to spread the load of storing and processing very large Data sets (such as those created by the Internet of Things) and provide a range of tools and software that support advanced statistical analysis. These servers can be on-premises or cloud-based with associated security. Big Data technologies are particularly adept at handling Unstructured Data.

Big Data technologies that are included in the Data and Analytics Dictionary include:

Cassandra
Flink
Hadoop
HDFS
Hive (HiveQL)
Pig and
Spark

# Data Operation & Technology
Collation of data to provide information (run the business effectively)
- Data Reporting 

- Dashboards
A Dashboard is a single page or pane (often a web-page) which simultaneously displays multiple different measurements of the performance of an organisation or sub-unit of this (division, department, geographic territory). The Information is generally at a high-level (with the ability to look into more details if required) and at least some of it may be presented in graphical form (e.g. charts, traffic lights, dials and more advanced Data Visualisations).

The content of Dashboards is frequently drawn from an organisation’s KPIs. Dashboards may represent what is happening at a point in time (e.g. month-end) or what is happening now; or both of these perspectives may be mixed (e.g. profit last month versus new business booked up to 5 minutes ago). The term is taken from the instrumentation of cars and aeroplanes.

# Data Analytics & Insight
Leverage of data to generate insight (move the needle commercially)
- Data Visualisation
- Data Science
- Data Engineering
- Artificial Intelligence
- Predictive Analytics
- "Skunkworks"

# Data Management
Control of data to ensure it is fit for purpose (sound decision/compliance)

## Data Governance

The management processes, policies and standards necessary to ensure that Data captured or generated within an organisation is of an appropriate standard to use, represents actual business facts and has its integrity preserved when transferred to repositories (e.g. Data Lakes and / or Data Warehouses, General Ledgers etc.), especially when this transfer involves aggregation or merging of different Data sets. The activities that Data Governance has oversight of include the operation of and changes to Systems of Record and the activities of Data Management and Analytics departments (which may be merged into one unit, or discrete but with close collaboration).

Data Governance has a strategic role, often involving senior management. Day-to-day tasks supporting Data Governance are often carried out by a Data Management team.
